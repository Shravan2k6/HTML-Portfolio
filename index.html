            About This Project:<br>
            This project highlights my personal ranking of the top games for both PC and mobile platforms. 
            <br>It’s a simple, clean webpage built to organize information in an accessible way while showing my ability to structure content, work with lists, and present data clearly using only HTML. The goal wasn’t complexity, it was to practice building a functional layout, focus on readability, and demonstrate how I approach small but complete web projects.

            This project is a basic birthday invitation webpage created to practice structuring content and working with fundamental HTML elements. 
            <br>It includes event details, images, and links, keeping the layout simple while focusing on clarity and proper formatting. The goal was to learn how to present information in a neat, organized way and build a small, complete page from scratch.
